# Finger exercise: The infection-fatality rate for a disease is the
# number of people who contract the disease divided by the number of
# those people who die from the disease. The case-fatality rate for a
# disease is the number of people who are diagnosed with the disease
# divided by the number of those people who die from the disease.
# Which of these is easier to estimate accurately, and why?

# The case-fatality rate is easier to estimate because you have a confirmed
# diagnosis. Some number of people will never be diagnosed with the disease
# and yet will die from the disease.
