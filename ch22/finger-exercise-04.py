# Finger exercise: On May 19, 2020, the New York Times reported a
# 123% increase in U.S. air travel in a single month (from 95,161
# passengers to 212,508 passengers). It also reported that this increase
# followed a recent 96% drop in air travel. What was the total net
# percentage change?

# (212508 - 95161) / 95161 = 1.23 = 123%
# (95161 - X) / X = -0.96
# 95161 - X = -0.96X
# 95161 = 0.04X
# X = 95161 / 0.04 = 2379025

# Total net percentage change
# (212508 - 2379025) / 2379025 = -0.91 = -91%
