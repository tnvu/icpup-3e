# Finger exercise: Computers can be annoyingly literal. If you don't
# tell them exactly what you want them to do, they are likely to do the
# wrong thing. Try writing an algorithm for driving between two
# destinations. Write it the way you would for a person, and then
# imagine what would happen if that person were as stupid as a
# computer, and executed the algorithm exactly as written. (For an
# amusing illustration of this, take a look at the video
# https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FN2RM-CHkuI&t=24s.)

# 1. Get instructions
# 2. Follow first instruction
# 3. If at destination stop, else follow next instruction
