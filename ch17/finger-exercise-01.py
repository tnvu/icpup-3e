# Finger exercise: Andrea averages 5 strokes a hole when she plays
# golf. One day, she took 40 strokes to complete the first nine holes.
# Her partner conjectured that she would probably regress to the mean
# and take 50 strokes to complete the next nine holes. Do you agree
# with her partner?

# No. She is more likely to be closer to 45 strokes on the next 9 holes.
# Her partner has fallen for the gambler's fallacy.
