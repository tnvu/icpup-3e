# Finger exercise: In Figure 17-19, why are the bins near the middle
# of the histogram taller than the bins near the sides? Hint: think
# about why 7 is the most common outcome of rolling a pair of dice.

# Bins near the middle of the histogram are taller than the bins near the 
# sides because there are more pairs of numbers between 0-100 that add up to
# the numbers in the middle bins
