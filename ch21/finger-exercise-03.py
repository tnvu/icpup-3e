# Finger exercise: You are wandering through a forest and see a
# field of delicious-looking mushrooms. You fill your basket with them,
# and head home prepared to cook them up and serve them to your
# husband. Before you cook them, however, he demands that you
# consult a book about local mushroom species to check whether they
# are poisonous. The book says that 80% of the mushrooms in the local
# forest are poisonous. However, you compare your mushrooms to the
# ones pictured in the book, and decide that you are 95% certain that
# your mushrooms are safe. How comfortable should you be about
# serving them to your husband (assuming that you would rather not
# become a widow)?

# A = mushroom is safe
# B = confident that mushroom is safe
# P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)
#        = (0.95 * 0.2 + 0.05 * 0.8) * 0.2 / 0.95
#        =~ 0.0484
