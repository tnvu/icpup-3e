Introduction to Computation and Programming Using Python, Third Edition

Review:

I did not like this book. The first 12 chapters are a good introduction to 
programming, Python, and computer science in general. The second half of the 
book that focuses on plotting, data science, and machine learning is not good.
The code examples in the book are often filled with errors which makes it even
harder to follow the examples when the code fails or even worse, it runs but
gives incorrect results. Only to debug the program and find that the error is 
in the sample code.

With many errors, it feels like the book was rushed and didn't have enough
proofreading. The inclusion of the data science and machine learning are not
explained well enough to actually understand what is going on and it's just
a lot of copying code to make it run -- especially the data science portion.
It seems that these two areas are hot topics right now and was included in
the text to make it relevant instead of continuing to focus on core areas of
computer science.
