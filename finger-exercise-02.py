# Finger exercise: Estimate the probability that a randomly chosen
# American is both male and weighs more than 197 pounds. Assume
# that 50% of the population is male, and that the weights of the male
# population are normally distributed with a mean of 210 pounds and a
# standard deviation of 30 pounds. (Hint: think about using the
# empirical rule.)

# P(male) * P(weight > 197 | male) = 0.5 * 0.84
#                                  = 0.42
